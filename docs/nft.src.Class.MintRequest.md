# Class: MintRequest

## Properties overview

- address:  PublicKey = PublicKey; [竊余(#address)
- customFlag:  Bool = Bool; [竊余(#customflag)
- customId:  Field = Field; [竊余(#customid)
- owner:  PublicKey = PublicKey; [竊余(#owner)

Represents a request to mint a new NFT, used by the admin contract to determine if minting is allowed.

## Extends

- \{
  `address`: `PublicKey`;
  `customFlag`: `Bool`;
  `customId`: `Field`;
  `owner`: `PublicKey`;
 \}

## Constructors

### new MintRequest()

```ts
new MintRequest(value: {
  address: PublicKey;
  customFlag: Bool;
  customId: Field;
  owner: PublicKey;
 }): MintRequest
```

#### Parameters

##### value

###### address

`PublicKey` = `PublicKey`

The address of the NFT contract where the NFT will be minted.

###### customFlag

`Bool` = `Bool`

A custom flag that can be interpreted by the admin contract, possibly forming a PublicKey with customId.

###### customId

`Field` = `Field`

A custom identifier that can be interpreted by the admin contract.

###### owner

`PublicKey` = `PublicKey`

The owner of the new NFT (can be different from the sender).

#### Returns

[`MintRequest`](nftsrcclassmintrequest)
