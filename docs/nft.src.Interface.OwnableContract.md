# Interface: OwnableContract

## Methods overview

- transferOwnership() [â†—](#transferownership)

Defined in: [packages/nft/src/interfaces/ownable.ts:14](https://github.com/zkcloudworker/minatokens-lib/blob/main/packages/nft/src/interfaces/ownable.ts#L14)

Interface representing ownable functionality for smart contracts.

The `OwnableContract` interface extends `SmartContract` and provides methods to ensure that only the owner
can perform certain actions and to allow the transfer of ownership to a new owner.

By implementing the Ownable interface, contracts can secure critical operations and provide a transparent
mechanism for ownership management.
